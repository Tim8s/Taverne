Contents Description
---------------------------

Many of these assets have custom pivot locaitons to accomodate grid snapping and reduce efforts to align assets to other modular surfaces.

The modules under the Architecture folder are designed to snap to whole or half grid units to form a seamless arrangement of walls, floor tiles, trim, and other components that contribute to a functional-looking interior room.  

The other assets will complement architectural design and help your interior structures feel more natural and lived-in.

Additional Features & Information
---------------------------

All FBX files contain greyscale vertex color data.  This can be used in conjunction with custom shaders that support vertex colors.  The vertex colors work best along with the diffuse textures with an Overlay effect.

Some textures were painted at a higher resolution than what may be needed; select the texture file and reduce the Max Size as necessary.
